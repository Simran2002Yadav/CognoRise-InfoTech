# CognoRise InfoTech - Data Analytics Intern(December 2023 - January 2024)

At CognoRise InfoTech, I utilized Power BI and Python for data analysis. I analyzed COVID-19-induced unemployment in India and conducted detailed analysis on the nutritional profiles of 80 cereal products using Python. I also developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing over 2000 customer records, providing valuable insights that enhanced the businessâ€™s understanding of customer personas and informed strategic decision-making.
